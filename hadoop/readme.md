The text from the input text file is tokenized into words to form a key value pair with all the words present in the input text file. The key is the word from the input file and value is ‘1’.

For instance if you consider the sentence “An elephant is an animal”. The mapper phase in the WordCount example will split the string into individual tokens i.e. words. In this case, the entire sentence will be split into 5 tokens (one for each word) with a value 1 as shown below
