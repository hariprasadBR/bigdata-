# Word Count - Hadoop Map Reduce Example – How it works?
Hadoop WordCount operation occurs in 3 stages –

1) Mapper Phase
2) Shuffle Phase
3) Reducer Phase

### Hadoop WordCount Example- Mapper Phase Execution
The text from the input text file is tokenized into words to form a key value pair with all the words present in the input text file. The key is the word from the input file and value is ‘1’.

For instance if you consider the sentence “the quick brown fox jumped over lazy dogs quick dogs jumped jumped”. The mapper phase in the WordCount example will split the string into individual tokens i.e. words. In this case, the entire sentence will be split into 12 tokens (one for each word) with a value 1 as shown below –

#### Key-Value pairs from Hadoop Map Phase Execution-
the quick brown fox jumped over lazy dogs quick dogs jumped jumped
- (the,1)
- (quick,1) 
- (brown,1) 
- (fox,1) 
- (jumped,1) 
- (over,1) 
- (lazy,1) 
- (dogs,1) 
- (quick,1)
- (dogs,1)
- (jumped,1)
- (jumped,1)

#### Hadoop WordCount Example- Shuffle Phase Execution

After the map phase execution is completed successfully, shuffle phase is executed automatically wherein the key-value pairs generated in the map phase are taken as input and then sorted in alphabetical order. After the shuffle phase is executed from the WordCount example code, the output will look like this -
- (brown,1)
- (dogs,1) 
- (dogs,1)
- (fox,1)
- (jumped,1)
- (jumped,1)
- (jumpe,1)
- (lazy,1)
- (over,1)
- (quick,1)
- (the,1)

#### Hadoop WordCount Example- Reducer Phase Execution
In the reduce phase, all the keys are grouped together and the values for similar keys are added up to find the occurrences for a particular word. It is like an aggregation phase for the keys generated by the map phase. The reducer phase takes the output of shuffle phase as input and then reduces the key-value pairs to unique keys with values added up. In our example “An elephant is an animal.” is the only word that appears twice in the sentence. After the execution of the reduce phase of MapReduce WordCount example program, appears as a key only once but with a count of 2 as shown below -
- (brown,1)
- (dogs,2)
- (fox,1)
- (jumped,3)
- (lazy,1)
- (over,1)
- (quick,1)
- (the,1)
